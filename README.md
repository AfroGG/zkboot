# Zettelkasten bootstrapping

The main idea here is to collect and create digital ZK templates to allow newcomers to quickly onboard and start using Zettelkasten method.

The structure and content of this repository is open for discussion.

[An example of how a template could look like](./martin-adams.md)

## Some additional ideas
We could include the whole workspace which can be downloaded and ready to start working with it.
For example we could include the pre-set Obsidian vault containing all the templates, plugins etc.
